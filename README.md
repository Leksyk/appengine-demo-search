appengine-demo-search
=====================

Demo Application for my AppEngine Tech Talk - demonstrates a simple "web search" app that crawls hardcoded list of URLs, parses their html content and extracts keywords, puts keywords into appengine search index and serves documents from that index per users' requests.

The application is hosted at: http://volodya-app.appspot.com
